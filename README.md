Monorepo for websites

## Development

You'll need Node.js to develop and build websites. We are using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for worspace management and automation. 

```bash
cd hckr.studio
yarn start
```

## Build

Websites are build with [Blendid](https://github.com/hckr-studio/blendid) static website builder.

```bash
cd hckr.studio
yarn build
```

Build results are in `.blendid/public/hckr.studio`.

## Deploy

Websites are hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). Infrastructure is managed with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/). Deployment pipeline runs on [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hckr-studio/websites).
